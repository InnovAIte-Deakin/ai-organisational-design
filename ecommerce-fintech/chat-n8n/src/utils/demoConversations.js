The workflow will wait 1 hour, then send a friendly reminder email\n3. If no action is taken, it will send a second email after 24 hours with a 5% discount\n4. If still no action, a final email with a 10% discount will be sent after 72 hours\n\nThe emails will include:\n- The abandoned products with images\n- A clear call-to-action button\n- Personalized content based on browsing history\n\nWould you like me to set up this workflow in n8n for you?",
