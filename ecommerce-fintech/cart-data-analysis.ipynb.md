# Cart Data Analysis Notebook

This Jupyter notebook provides data analysis and visualization tools for e-commerce cart data. The notebook demonstrates how to analyze customer cart patterns, identify abandonment reasons, and generate recovery strategies.

## Features

- **Cart Abandonment Analysis**: Statistical analysis of cart abandonment patterns
- **Customer Segmentation**: Techniques for segmenting customers based on behavior
- **Recovery Strategy Testing**: A/B testing frameworks for recovery methods
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs for visualizing cart metrics
- **Cost Analysis**: Calculations for understanding the financial impact of cart abandonment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

### Running the Notebook

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

2. Launch Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open `cart-data-analysis.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface

## Sections

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Loading**: Connecting to the cart data server and loading sample data
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Initial data exploration and summary statistics
3. **Abandonment Patterns**: Analysis of when and why carts are abandoned
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Clustering customers based on shopping behavior
5. **Recovery Strategy Analysis**: Evaluating different approaches to cart recovery
6. **Financial Impact**: Calculating the cost of cart abandonment and ROI of recovery strategies

8. **Integration with MCP**: How to connect these insights with the MCP tools

## Integration with AI Co-founder

This notebook provides the analytical foundation for the Cart Recovery agent in the AI Co-founder system. The insights gained from this analysis inform the AI's decision-making process when generating recovery strategies.

## Data Sources

The notebook can work with the following data sources:

1. **Sample Data**: Built-in sample data for demonstration purposes
2. **Cart Data Server**: Live data from the cart-data-server module
3. **CSV Import**: Ability to import your own cart data in CSV format
